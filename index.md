NinjaStars are here to provide step-by-step (ooh baby) guides for infrastrucure and code samples you'll need, and that demonstrate stages of the cybersecurity attack chain. The goal is to provide engineers with a bag of tools to demonstrate various parts of the Snyk platform.

<p>
Many of the examples include real malicious indicators and could get your computer and computers connected to that computer compromised. To reduce this risk it is recommended to at least use VM's with sharing disabled, and have a good snapshot of the core image.

Each post should be labelled with a <a href="/categories/">Category</a> and <a href="/tag/">Tag</a>. Categories are alingned with <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" taget="_blank">Mitre Att&ck</a>. Tags map each post to individual solutions. This way you could stack a bunch of Gateway ninja stars together for a more robust attack.
